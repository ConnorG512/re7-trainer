Resident Evil 7
Triggered when making a purchase in the gear shop
Info for address: 0x0000000141d80664
0x141d80664:	mov    0x58(%rsi),%rbx
r15 = current player gear

it seems that gear maybe being reduced at instructions:
0x141d80670:	sub    ebp,DWORD PTR [rsi+0x6c]
At this address the value stored at rsi+0x06 is the amount of gear that the player has before the player made the purchase. ebp stores the amount after which is then subbed to make the price of the item. That price is then stored in ebp.
The value at "0x6c(%rsi)" was the amount that I had picked up in game

0x141d80673:	mov    DWORD PTR [rsi+0x6c],r15d
on this instruction, setting r15d register will change the amount of gear after the purchase.
using "set $r15d = 999999999999" caused an integer overflow to - meaning that the check for max is bypassed here
